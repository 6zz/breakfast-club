# Breakfast club

A place for üç©'s and maybe üç∞'s

## Getting Started

Cut a branch with whatever name you want but please have it in this format `yourNickname-solutions`. This branch will be the branch you'll be working off of -- just so we can keep things organized. You *don't* have to push your code up but it would be cool to be able to go through all the available solutions and compare answers.

Maybe you have an awesome solution? Would be cool to share!

I'll be posting the question of the week in this repository and you should be able to find the solution the following week or so in the `solutions` branch.
